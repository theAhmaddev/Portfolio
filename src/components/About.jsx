        I’m Muhammad Ahmad, a BSCS student at the University of Sahiwal with hands-on experience in mobile app development using Flutter. My expertise lies in building responsive, cross-platform applications with clean UI and efficient performance. I have a strong foundation in Dart programming, Firebase integration, and RESTful API connectivity. I’ve deployed and tested applications on both Android and iOS platforms. Currently, I’m expanding my skills in backend integration and exploring cloud services to build scalable mobile solutions.
